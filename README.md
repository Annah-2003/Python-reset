# Guessing Game by Irene Gitau

This is a simple guessing game written in Python. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. I created this to gain a deeper understanding of Python

## How to Play
 
1. Run the `guessing_game.py` script.
2. Follow the instructions to guess the number.
3. Keep guessing until you get it right!

# Number Facts

`Additionally, you can use the `number_facts.py` script to get interesting facts about any number. Simply run the script and enter a number when prompted.`

Have fun!
